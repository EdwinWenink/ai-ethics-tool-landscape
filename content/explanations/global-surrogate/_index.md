title: Global surrogate models
---

One approach to explain predictions of "black box" models is to approximate its predictions with a
{{< explanation "white box" >}} model that *is* interpretable.
A *global* surrogate model is a model that tries to do this approximation for a larger set of instances, ideally the whole input feature range.
Also see {{< explanation "local surrogate" >}} models.
