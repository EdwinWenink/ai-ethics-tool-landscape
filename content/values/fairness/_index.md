title: Fairness

When trying to operationalize fairness it is important to realize that fairness in machine learning is a complex socio-technical issue.
At minimum, this means that fairness tools should never be seen as plug-and-play solutions.
This is already evident from the fact that - as most of the listed tools will emphasize - choices have to be made in which *type* of fairness is strived for.
One general distinction for example is between [group fairness](/fairness/group-fairness) and [individual fairness](/fairness/individual-fairness).
Additionally, there are different [stages](/stages/) in the machine learning pipeline where you can intervene.
