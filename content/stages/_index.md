title: Stages
---

The typical machine learning pipeline typically starts with a *preprocessing* stage.
Within the scope of this project, this stage also includes data exploration.
After preprocessing comes learning, evaluation and prediction.
In a typical training loop you also already do prediction and evaluation.
To keep things simple, all steps of a typical training loop are summarized as *in-processing*.

Some methods for ethical AI are  applied *before* the machine learning pipeline is developed, for example approaches to translating AI principles into design requirements.
This stage is called the *design phase*.
Additionally, some tools are applied *after* a model is trained and predictions are made, which we can call *post-processing* or post-hoc.
Post-hoc explainability methods are a good example of this.
Model evaluation after the training loop is also categorized as post-processing.
