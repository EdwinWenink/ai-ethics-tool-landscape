title: Stages
---

The typical AI machine learning pipeline roughly consists of four stages:

- Preprocessing
- Learning
- Evaluation
- Prediction

Tools can address one or multiple of these stages.
Some methods for ethical AI are  applied *before* the machine learning pipeline is developed, for example approaches to translating AI principles into design requirements.
Additionally, some tools are applied *after* the whole machine learning pipeline.
Post-hoc explainability methods are a good example of this.
This leads to two additional stages:

- Design phase
- Post-hoc
