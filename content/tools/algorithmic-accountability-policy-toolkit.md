*AI Now* published the *Algorithmic Accountability Policy Toolkit* in 2018.
It is specifically tailored towards advocates concerned with government use of algorithms.
The toolkit provides a FAQ, an overview of various types of algorithms used by governments in specific application areas such as public health or criminal justice, and a comprehensive list of relevant literature.

The fact that this is a *toolkit* and not a paper can be seen from the very practical guidance that is offered.
For example, this toolkit offers a guide for advocates on how to request public records. 
In this practical manner, the toolkit supports advocates in promoting accountability for the use of algorithms.
