The IBM AI Fairness 360 Toolkit contains several bias mitigation algorithms that are applicable to various stages of a machine learning pipeline.
Different algorithms may also implement different notions of [fairness](/values/fairness), for example on the level of individuals or on the level of groups.
Moreover, the choice for a particular algorithm from the toolkit also depends on assumptions on the equality of people.
The toolkit provides excellent [guidance on choosing metrics and mitigation](http://aif360.mybluemix.net/resources#guidance) given a particular goal and application.
