This toolkit developed by the Utrecht Data School supports data analysts, projectmanagers, and policy makers in identifying ethical values and issues in data projects and promoting accountability towards stakeholders. 
The toolkit is written in Dutch and includes a poster to support brainstorm sessions, an interactive survey, and an accompanying guide with further explanations. 
On the toolkit's website you can also find several case studies that highlight ethical issues in data projects, as well as a version of the toolkit specifically for researchers.
There is also an interactive app available.
