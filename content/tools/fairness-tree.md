This fairness tree is shown in the web version of the {{< tool "Aequitas" >}} bias and fairness audit toolkit.
It's main purpose is to help decide on a suitable fairness metric, given the data set and the type of problem.
Because this can also be useful to be used with other fairness toolkits, it merited its own entry.
