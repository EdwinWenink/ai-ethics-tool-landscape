title:  Tools
---

This wiki focuses on practical tools for implementing ethical AI, but not all of these tools are strictly technical.
Particularly in the case of {{< value "accountability" >}}, the listed tools can be methodologies or frameworks.

However, a prerequisite to be listed on this wiki is that some form of practical guidance must be offered. 
In case of accountability, the tool may for example not be offered in a code repository, but instead in a paper that contains a practical component, e.g. a set of instructions, guidelines or guiding questions.
