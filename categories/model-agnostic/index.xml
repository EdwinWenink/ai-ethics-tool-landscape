Finding adversarial examples is relevant for assessing the security of machine learning models. Machine learning models learn complex statistical patterns in datasets. If these statistical patterns &amp;ldquo;drift&amp;rdquo; (in unforeseen ways) after a model is deployed, this will decrease the model performance over time. In systems where model predictions have an impact on people, this may be a threat to the fairness of the predictions.</description></item><item><title>ART: Adversial Robustness 360 Toolbox</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/art/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/art/</guid><description>The Adversial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is the first comprehensive toolbox that unifies many defensive techniques for four categories of adversarial attacks on machine learning models.

Abstract:
The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information.</description></item><item><title>DEDA: De Ethische Data Assistent</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deda/</guid><description>This toolkit developed by the Utrecht Data School supports data analysts, projectmanagers, and policy makers in identifying ethical values and issues in data projects and promoting accountability towards stakeholders.

DiCE implements counterfactual (CF) explanations that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000. In other words, it provides &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.
A main innovation of DiCE is that it implements a method to make producing counter-factual examples more model-agnostic:</description></item><item><title>ELI5</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/</guid><description>ELI5 (&amp;ldquo;Explain Like I&amp;rsquo;m 5&amp;rdquo;) provides model-specific support for models from scikit-learn, lightning, decision tree ensembles using the xgboost, LightGBM, CatBoost libraries.

Dataset description:
Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems and resources. Further, there is a lack of benchmark datasets for examining inappropriate biases in system predictions. Here, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders.</description></item><item><title>FactSheets: Increasing Trust in AI Services through Supplier's Declaration of Conformity</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/factsheets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/factsheets/</guid><description>FactSheets, as proposed by Arnold et al. from IBM Research, are similar to the model-card and datasheet , but are significantly more comprehensive because they focus on whole AI services.

It is emphasized that fairness algorithms are no plug-and-play technical solutions, but require serious thought about the context of the data and the problem at hand.

They may be helpful for certain tasks such as assessing unfairness through various metrics, or to mitigate observed unfairness when training a model.</description></item><item><title>Fairness Decision Tree</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairness-tree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairness-tree/</guid><description>This fairness tree is shown in the web version of the Aequitas bias and fairness audit toolkit.

A set of interpretable &amp;ldquo;glassbox&amp;rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems. W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &amp;ldquo;glassbox&amp;rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.</description></item><item><title>LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/</guid><description>The type of explanation LIME offers is a surrogate model that approximates a black box prediction locally. The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually sufficiently representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&amp;rsquo;s behaviour.</description></item><item><title>Model cards for Model Reporting</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</guid><description>Model cards are an extension of the datasheet to machine learning models.
Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains.</description></item><item><title>SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/</guid><description>The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley value and can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.</description></item><item><title>SMACTR: End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</guid><description>Introduction A major downside of external auditing is that it typically only can be done after model deployment. This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodical—antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.</description></item><item><title>What-If Tool</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/what-if-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/what-if-tool/</guid><description>The What-If Tool (WIT) takes a pretrained model and then allows you to visualize the effect of changing e.g. classification thresholds or the data points themselves on performance, explainability and fairness metrics.

A function to balance the data is offered through basic up- or downsampling, but other than this no fairness criteria are defined.
Compared to other libraries the XAI Toolbox is very basic and currently the roadmap (which is not updated since 2019) does not include any major improvements.</description></item></channel></rss>
