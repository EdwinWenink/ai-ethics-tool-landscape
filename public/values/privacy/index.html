		Butnaru and others associated with the HAI center at Stanford set up a Agile Ethics workflow in the form of a Trello board. From left to right, the workflow walks you through relevant ethical considerations at the various steps of a machine learning pipeline. The phases are:
 Scope  Consider ethical implications of the project Consider skill mapping (what&rsquo;s the impact of AI on jobs)?  Facilitates up-skilling or a change of strategy in the use of human talent     Data audit  Led by Chief Data Officer &ldquo;Meet and plan&rdquo; stage in Agile Helpful: Data Ethics Canvas   Train  Build stage in Agile Consider (tools for) transparency and fairness   Analyse  Benchmarks, including benchmarks related to e.

		AlgorithmWatch is maintaining a searchable inventory of published frameworks that set out ethical AI values. They can be searched on sector/actor, type, region and location.
AlgorithmWatch noted some common patterns here after publishing the first version of the index:
 &ldquo;All include the similar principles on transparency, equality/non-discrimination, accountability and safety. Some add additional principles, such as the demand for AI be socially beneficial and protect human rights.&rdquo; &ldquo;Most frameworks are developed by coalitions, or institutions such as universities that then invite companies and individuals to sign up to these.

	<div>
		The Data Ethics Canvas is a tool developed by the Open Data Institute for providing ethical guidance to organizations doing any type of project involving data. That includes data collection, sharing, and its usage for example in machine learning applications. The tool is accompanied with a white paper and a brief practical guide for its usage.
Page 3 of the practical guide lists some recommendations that are also relevant when you do not use this tool.
