	<div>
		The Adversial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is the first comprehensive toolbox that unifies many defensive techniques for four categories of adversial attacks on machine learning models. These categories are model evasion, model poisoning, model extraction and inference (e.g. inference of sensitive attributes in the training data; or determining whether an example was part of the training data). ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks, all data types and all machine learning tasks.

	<h1><a href="http://example.org/tools/debiaswe/">Debiaswe: try to make word embeddings less sexist</a></h1>
    
	
	<div>
		Word embeddings are a widely used representation for text data. A well-known example in natural language processing (NLP) is Word2vec, which uses a neural network to learn latent vector representations of words. It turns out that relations in this latent vector space capture semantic relations quite well. For example, by finding similar vectors you typically end up with highly related or synonymous words. Another typical example is that when you add up the vectors of &ldquo;king&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo;, you end up with the vector corresponding to &ldquo;queen&rdquo;, so even a form of conceptual calculus is possible.

	<h1><a href="http://example.org/tools/dice/">DiCE: Diverse Counterfactual Explanations</a></h1>
    
	
	<div>
		From README:
 DiCE implements counterfactual (CF) explanations that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000. In other words, it provides &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.
 A main innovation of DiCE is that it implements a method to make producing counter-factual examples more model-agnostic:

	<div>
		Interpret-Text is an extension of InterpretML, specifically for several text models. Three modules are provided: ClassicalTextExplainer, UnifiedInformationExplainer and IntrospectiveRationaleExplainer.
Classical Text Explainer The ClassicalTextExplainer supports linear models from sklearn with a coefs_ call and tree-based models for which feature_importances_ is defined.
ClassicalTextExplainer includes a NLP pipeline from preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning, so it accepts raw text data as input. The default pipeline uses a unigram bag-of-words model. Elements of the pipeline can be replaced if desired.

	<h1><a href="http://example.org/tools/interpretml/">InterpretML</a></h1>
    
	
	<div>
		The InterpretML toolkit, developed at Microsoft, can be decomposed in two major components:
 A set of interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems.  W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.

	<h1><a href="http://example.org/tools/shap/">SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</a></h1>
    
	
	<div>
		The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley valueand can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
 Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.
