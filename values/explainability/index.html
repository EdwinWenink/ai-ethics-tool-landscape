<a href=/values/fairness/>fairness</a>
and for trust in AI systems.
There is little consensus about what &ldquo;explainability&rdquo; precisely is.
The related concepts of &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; and &ldquo;interpretability&rdquo; are sometimes used as synonyms, sometimes distinctly.
For example, the explainability of machine learning models can be seen as one aspect of the overall need to be transparent in the use of AI (so transparency is the superconcept).
But one may also use the word &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; to indicate &ldquo;white box&rdquo; models that are in themselves interpretable.
The predictions of opaque black box models can however nevertheless be explained, so in this sense &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; is a subconcept of &ldquo;explainability&rdquo;.</p><p>Technical tools assume and implement <a href=/explanations/>various different types of explanation</a>.
It is important to be aware of the limitations of the particular interpretation of &ldquo;explainability&rdquo; that is used.
Generally speaking, there is a quite large gap between technical implementations of explainability and what humans generally consider to be a good explanation.</p></div></div><article><h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/agile_ethics_for_ai/>Agile Ethics for AI</a></h1><div>Butnaru and others associated with the HAI center at Stanford set up a Agile Ethics workflow in the form of a Trello board. From left to right, the workflow walks you through relevant ethical considerations at the various steps of a machine learning pipeline. The phases are:

They can be searched on sector/actor, type, region and location.
AlgorithmWatch noted some common patterns here after publishing the first version of the index:
&ldquo;All include the similar principles on transparency, equality/non-discrimination, accountability and safety. Some add additional principles, such as the demand for AI be socially beneficial and protect human rights.&rdquo; &ldquo;Most frameworks are developed by coalitions, or institutions such as universities that then invite companies and individuals to sign up to these.

That includes data collection, sharing, and its usage for example in machine learning applications. The tool is accompanied with a white paper and a brief practical guide for its usage.
Page 3 of the practical guide lists some recommendations that are also relevant when you do not use this tool.

DiCE implements counterfactual (CF) explanations that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000. In other words, it provides &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.
A main innovation of DiCE is that it implements a method to make producing counter-factual examples more model-agnostic:

Three modules are provided: ClassicalTextExplainer, UnifiedInformationExplainer and IntrospectiveRationaleExplainer.
Classical Text Explainer The ClassicalTextExplainer supports linear models from sklearn with a coefs_ call and tree-based models for which feature_importances_ is defined.
ClassicalTextExplainer includes a NLP pipeline from preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning, so it accepts raw text data as input. The default pipeline uses a unigram bag-of-words model. Elements of the pipeline can be replaced if desired.

A set of interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems. W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.

The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&rsquo;s behaviour.

So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.
