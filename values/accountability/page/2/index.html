The fact that this is a toolkit and not a paper can be seen from the very practical guidance that is offered.

According to the authors, their approach is different from the datasheet in that the &ldquo;proposed datasheet [i.e. by Gebru et al.] includes dataset provenance, key characteristics, relevant regulations and test results, but also significant yet more subjective information such as potential bias, strengths and weaknesses of the dataset, API, or model, and suggested uses.

Abstract:
The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information.

The toolkit is written in Dutch and includes a poster to support brainstorm sessions, an interactive survey, and an accompanying guide with further explanations. On the toolkit&rsquo;s website you can also find several case studies that highlight ethical issues in data projects, as well as a version of the toolkit specifically for researchers.

A main difference is that live AI services may comprise several trained models that interact with each other. The model card and datasheet instead concern a single model and the data it is trained on. However, Arnold et al. point out that an AI service with safe components is not necessarily safe overall and &ldquo;so it is prudent to also consider transparency and accountability of services in addition to datasets and models&rdquo; (p.

Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains.

This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodical—antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.
