From left to right, the workflow walks you through relevant ethical considerations at the various steps of a machine learning pipeline. The phases are:

That includes data collection, sharing, and its usage for example in machine learning applications. The tool is accompanied with a white paper and a brief practical guide for its usage.
Page 3 of the practical guide lists some recommendations that are also relevant when you do not use this tool.</description></item></channel></rss>
