From left to right, the workflow walks you through relevant ethical considerations at the various steps of a machine learning pipeline. The phases are:

These categories are model evasion, model poisoning, model extraction and inference (e.g. inference of sensitive attributes in the training data; or determining whether an example was part of the training data). ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks, all data types and all machine learning tasks.</description></item><item><title>SMACTR: End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</guid><description>Introduction A major downside of external auditing is that it typically only can be done after model deployment. This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodicalâ€”antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.</description></item></channel></rss>
