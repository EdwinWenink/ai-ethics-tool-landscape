The web interface offers a four step programme to audit a dataset on bias. The four steps are:
Upload (tabular) data Determine protected groups and reference group Select fairness metrics and disparity intolerance Inspect bias report Example audit report. This toolkit is useful for auditing bias and fairness according to a limited set of common fairness metrics, but does not offer algorithms for mitigating bias.</description></item><item><title>Agile Ethics for AI</title><link>http://example.org/tools/agile_ethics_for_ai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/agile_ethics_for_ai/</guid><description>Butnaru and others associated with the HAI center at Stanford set up a Agile Ethics workflow in the form of a Trello board.

These categories are model evasion, model poisoning, model extraction and inference (e.g. inference of sensitive attributes in the training data; or determining whether an example was part of the training data). ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks, all data types and all machine learning tasks.</description></item><item><title>Datasheets for Datasets</title><link>http://example.org/tools/datasheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/datasheet/</guid><description>The method described in this paper aids in documenting datasets to help avoid unwanted consequences of data usage.
Abstract:
The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information.</description></item><item><title>Debiaswe: try to make word embeddings less sexist</title><link>http://example.org/tools/debiaswe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/debiaswe/</guid><description>Word embeddings are a widely used representation for text data. A well-known example in natural language processing (NLP) is Word2vec, which uses a neural network to learn latent vector representations of words. It turns out that relations in this latent vector space capture semantic relations quite well. For example, by finding similar vectors you typically end up with highly related or synonymous words. Another typical example is that when you add up the vectors of &amp;ldquo;king&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo;, you end up with the vector corresponding to &amp;ldquo;queen&amp;rdquo;, so even a form of conceptual calculus is possible.</description></item><item><title>Fairlearn</title><link>http://example.org/tools/fairlearn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/fairlearn/</guid><description>The documentation of fairlearn is excellent and provides a good introduction to the topic of fairness in AI. It is emphasized that fairness algorithms are no plug-and-play technical solutions, but require serious thought about the context of the data and the problem at hand.
Fairness is a fundamentally sociotechnical challenge and cannot be solved with technical tools alone. They may be helpful for certain tasks such as assessing unfairness through various metrics, or to mitigate observed unfairness when training a model.</description></item><item><title>Fairness Decision Tree</title><link>http://example.org/tools/fairness-tree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/fairness-tree/</guid><description>This fairness tree is shown in the web version of the Aequitas bias and fairness audit toolkit. It&amp;rsquo;s main purpose is to help decide on a suitable fairness metric, given the data set and the type of problem. Because this can also be useful to be used with other fairness toolkits, it merited its own entry.</description></item><item><title>IBM AI Fairness 360</title><link>http://example.org/tools/ibm-ai-fairness-360/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/ibm-ai-fairness-360/</guid><description>The IBM AI Fairness 360 Toolkit contains several bias mitigation algorithms that are applicable to various stages of the machine learning pipeline. The toolkit implements different notions of fairness, both on individual and the group level, and several fairness metrics for both classes of fairness. The toolkit provides additional guidance on choosing metrics and mitigation algorithms given a particular goal and application.
The following should be noted when using the fairness toolkit (and other similar toolkits, for that matter):</description></item><item><title>SMACTR: End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing</title><link>http://example.org/tools/smactr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/smactr/</guid><description>Introduction A major downside of external auditing is that it typically only can be done after model deployment. This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodicalâ€”antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.</description></item></channel></rss>
