AdversialBox allows zero-coding generation of adversial examples for a wide range of neural network frameworks. An overview of the supported attacks and defenses can be found here and the corresponding code here. It requires some effort to find all attacks mentioned on the homepage in the code base.
Generally speaking, the documentation of AdvBox is incomplete and not very user-friendly. ODD: Object Detector Deception showcases a specific attack for object detection networks such as YOLO, but is not mentioned in the README.</description></item><item><title>Aequitas: Bias and Fairness Audit Toolkit</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/aequitas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/aequitas/</guid><description>Audit The Aequitas toolkit can both be used on the command-line, programmatically via its Python API or via a web interface.

Attacks (i.e. methods for generating adversarial examples) are listed under /cleverhans and each of the supported frameworks has its own folder with attack implementations. CleverHans also aims to implement a set of defenses, but this is currently work in progress (currently there is only a defense implementation for PyTorch).</description></item><item><title>Contrastive Explanation Method (CEM)</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/cem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/cem/</guid><description>Dhurandhar et al. support a type of contrastive explanation based on what they call pertinent negatives. A contrastive explanation answers the question: &amp;ldquo;Why P, rather than Q&amp;rdquo;?
CEM supports such an explanation by finding the minimal set of features that lead to prediction P (a pertinent positive that resembles an anchor explanation), and additionally a minimal set of features that should be absent to maintain decision P instead of the decision for closest class Q (a pertinent negative that is somewhat similar to a counterfactual ).</description></item><item><title>Data Ethics Canvas</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-ethics-canvas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-ethics-canvas/</guid><description>The Data Ethics Canvas is a tool developed by the Open Data Institute for providing ethical guidance to organizations doing any type of project involving data.

This package does not seem to be very actively maintained anymore and support for TensorFlow V2 is limited.
Attributions The README gives the following clear and succinct explanation of what an &amp;ldquo;attribution&amp;rdquo; is. All methods included in this approach allow visualization of how each input feature contributes to the final prediction, in terms of what a particular targeted neuron &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo;:</description></item><item><title>DeepLIFT</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deeplift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deeplift/</guid><description>A brief explanation of the gradient-based interpretability method called DeepLIFT is given by Shrikumar et al. in the abstract of the linked paper:
DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its &amp;lsquo;reference activation&amp;rsquo; and assigns contribution scores according to the difference.</description></item><item><title>DiCE: Diverse Counterfactual Explanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/dice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/dice/</guid><description>From README:
DiCE implements counterfactual (CF) explanations that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000. In other words, it provides &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.
A main innovation of DiCE is that it implements a method to make producing counter-factual examples more model-agnostic:</description></item><item><title>ELI5</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/</guid><description>ELI5 (&amp;ldquo;Explain Like I&amp;rsquo;m 5&amp;rdquo;) provides model-specific support for models from scikit-learn, lightning, decision tree ensembles using the xgboost, LightGBM, CatBoost libraries.

Dataset description:
Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems and resources. Further, there is a lack of benchmark datasets for examining inappropriate biases in system predictions. Here, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders.</description></item><item><title>FactSheets: Increasing Trust in AI Services through Supplier's Declaration of Conformity</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/factsheets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/factsheets/</guid><description>FactSheets, as proposed by Arnold et al. from IBM Research, are similar to the model-card and datasheet , but are significantly more comprehensive because they focus on whole AI services. A main difference is that live AI services may comprise several trained models that interact with each other. The model card and datasheet instead concern a single model and the data it is trained on. However, Arnold et al. point out that an AI service with safe components is not necessarily safe overall and &amp;ldquo;so it is prudent to also consider transparency and accountability of services in addition to datasets and models&amp;rdquo; (p.</description></item><item><title>Fairlearn</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairlearn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairlearn/</guid><description>The documentation of fairlearn is excellent and provides a good introduction to the topic of fairness in AI. It is emphasized that fairness algorithms are no plug-and-play technical solutions, but require serious thought about the context of the data and the problem at hand.
Fairness is a fundamentally sociotechnical challenge and cannot be solved with technical tools alone. They may be helpful for certain tasks such as assessing unfairness through various metrics, or to mitigate observed unfairness when training a model.</description></item><item><title>Foolbox</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/foolbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/foolbox/</guid><description>Foolbox is a comprehensive adversarial library for attacking machine learning models, with a focus on neural networks in computer vision. At the moment of writing FoolBox contains 41 gradient-based and decision-based adversarial attacks, making it the second biggest adversial library after ART . A notable difference with ART is that Foolbox only contains attacks, but no defenses and evaluation metrics.
The library is very user-friendly, with a clear API and documentation.</description></item><item><title>H2O MLI Resources</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/h2o-mli-resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/h2o-mli-resources/</guid><description>This repository by H2O.ai contains useful resources and notebooks that showcase well-known machine learning interpretability techniques. The examples use the h2o Python package with their own estimators (e.g. their own fork of XGBoost), but all code is open-source and the examples are still illustrative of the interpretability techniques. These case studies that also deal with practical coding issues and preprocessing steps, e.g. that LIME can be unstable when there are strong correlations between input variables.</description></item><item><title>Interpret-Text</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpret-text/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpret-text/</guid><description>Interpret-Text is an extension of InterpretML , specifically for several text models. Three modules are provided: ClassicalTextExplainer, UnifiedInformationExplainer and IntrospectiveRationaleExplainer.
Classical Text Explainer The ClassicalTextExplainer supports linear models from sklearn with a coefs_ call and tree-based models for which feature_importances_ is defined.
ClassicalTextExplainer includes a NLP pipeline from preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning, so it accepts raw text data as input. The default pipeline uses a unigram bag-of-words model. Elements of the pipeline can be replaced if desired.</description></item><item><title>InterpretML</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpretml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpretml/</guid><description>The InterpretML toolkit, developed at Microsoft, can be decomposed in two major components:
A set of interpretable &amp;ldquo;glassbox&amp;rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems. W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &amp;ldquo;glassbox&amp;rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.</description></item><item><title>LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/</guid><description>The type of explanation LIME offers is a surrogate model that approximates a black box prediction locally. The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually sufficiently representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&amp;rsquo;s behaviour.</description></item><item><title>Model cards for Model Reporting</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</guid><description>Model cards are an extension of the datasheet to machine learning models.
Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains.</description></item><item><title>SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/</guid><description>The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley value and can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.</description></item><item><title>SMACTR: End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</guid><description>Introduction A major downside of external auditing is that it typically only can be done after model deployment. This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodical—antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.</description></item><item><title>What-If Tool</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/what-if-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/what-if-tool/</guid><description>The What-If Tool (WIT) takes a pretrained model and then allows you to visualize the effect of changing e.g. classification thresholds or the data points themselves on performance, explainability and fairness metrics.
Many convenient functions for gaining insight in the data set are provided, such as binning on particular features, attribution values, or inference scores, computing partial dependence plots, and typical performance indicators such as a confusion matrix or ROC curve.</description></item><item><title>XAI Toolbox</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/xai-toolbox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/xai-toolbox/</guid><description>This library is a small toolbox that offers some convenience functions for quickly visualizing imbalances in the data set, computing (permutation) feature importances and metrics such as the ROC-curve. A function to balance the data is offered through basic up- or downsampling, but other than this no fairness criteria are defined.
Compared to other libraries the XAI Toolbox is very basic and currently the roadmap (which is not updated since 2019) does not include any major improvements.</description></item></channel></rss>
