This stage is called the design phase.</description></item><item><title>Preprocessing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/stages/preprocessing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/stages/preprocessing/</guid><description>The typical machine learning pipeline starts with a preprocessing stage. Within the scope of this project, this stage also includes data exploration.</description></item><item><title>In-processing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/stages/in-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/stages/in-processing/</guid><description>After preprocessing comes learning, evaluation and prediction. In a typical training loop you also already do prediction and evaluation. To keep things simple, all steps of a typical training loop are summarized as in-processing.</description></item><item><title>Post-processing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/stages/post-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/stages/post-processing/</guid><description>Additionally, some tools are applied after a model is trained and predictions are made, which we can call post-processing or post-hoc. Post-hoc explainability methods are a good example of this. Model evaluation after the training loop is also categorized as post-processing.</description></item></channel></rss>
