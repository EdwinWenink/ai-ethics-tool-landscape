AlgorithmWatch noted some common patterns here after publishing the first version of the index:
&amp;ldquo;All include the similar principles on transparency, equality/non-discrimination, accountability and safety. Some add additional principles, such as the demand for AI be socially beneficial and protect human rights.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Most frameworks are developed by coalitions, or institutions such as universities that then invite companies and individuals to sign up to these.</description></item><item><title>Alibi Detect</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/alibi-detect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/alibi-detect/</guid><description>Alibi Detect is an open source Python library (sister library to Alibi ) focused detecting outliers, adversarial examples, and concept drift.
Finding adversarial examples is relevant for assessing the security of machine learning models. Machine learning models learn complex statistical patterns in datasets. If these statistical patterns &amp;ldquo;drift&amp;rdquo; (in unforeseen ways) after a model is deployed, this will decrease the model performance over time. In systems where model predictions have an impact on people, this may be a threat to the fairness of the predictions.</description></item><item><title>Data Ethics Canvas</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-ethics-canvas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-ethics-canvas/</guid><description>The Data Ethics Canvas is a tool developed by the Open Data Institute for providing ethical guidance to organizations doing any type of project involving data.

The goal of this method is to asses data quality and mitigate potential problems early on before building models on the data.
According to the authors, their approach is different from the datasheet in that the &amp;ldquo;proposed datasheet [i.e. by Gebru et al.] includes dataset provenance, key characteristics, relevant regulations and test results, but also significant yet more subjective information such as potential bias, strengths and weaknesses of the dataset, API, or model, and suggested uses.</description></item><item><title>Data Statements for NLP</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-statements-for-nlp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-statements-for-nlp/</guid><description>A data statement, according to the authors, is &amp;hellip;
a characterization of a dataset that provides context to allow developers and users to better understand how experimental results might generalize,how software might be appropriately deployed,and what biases might be reflected in systems built on the software. (587)
This paper specifically focuses on ethically responsive NLP technology. The authors argue that a data statement should be an integral part of work and writing on NLP.</description></item><item><title>Datasheets for Datasets</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/datasheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/datasheet/</guid><description>The method described in this paper aids in documenting datasets to help avoid unwanted consequences of data usage.
Abstract:
The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information.</description></item><item><title>DEDA: De Ethische Data Assistent</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deda/</guid><description>This toolkit developed by the Utrecht Data School supports data analysts, projectmanagers, and policy makers in identifying ethical values and issues in data projects and promoting accountability towards stakeholders. The toolkit is written in Dutch and includes a poster to support brainstorm sessions, an interactive survey, and an accompanying guide with further explanations. On the toolkit&amp;rsquo;s website you can also find several case studies that highlight ethical issues in data projects, as well as a version of the toolkit specifically for researchers.</description></item><item><title>Model cards for Model Reporting</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</guid><description>Model cards are an extension of the datasheet to machine learning models.
Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains.</description></item><item><title>SMACTR: End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</guid><description>Introduction A major downside of external auditing is that it typically only can be done after model deployment. This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodicalâ€”antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.</description></item></channel></rss>
