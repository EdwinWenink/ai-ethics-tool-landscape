The README already provides an overview of the supported methods and when they are applicable. The following table with supported methods is copied from the README (slightly abbreviated):

The examples use the h2o Python package with their own estimators (e.g. their own fork of XGBoost), but all code is open-source and the examples are still illustrative of the interpretability techniques. These case studies that also deal with practical coding issues and preprocessing steps, e.g. that LIME can be unstable when there are strong correlations between input variables.</description></item></channel></rss>
