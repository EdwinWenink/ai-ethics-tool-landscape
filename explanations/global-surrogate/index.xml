AIX360 offers excellent guidance material, an interactive demo as well as developer tutorials. What&amp;rsquo;s particularly good about this material is that it stimulates reflection on which type of explanation is appropriate, not only from a technical point of view, but also with respect to the target explainer and explainee.</description></item><item><title>Alibi</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/alibi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/alibi/</guid><description>Alibi is an open-source Python library that supports various interpretability techniques and a broad array of explanation types. The README already provides an overview of the supported methods and when they are applicable. The following table with supported methods is copied from the README (slightly abbreviated):

The examples use the h2o Python package with their own estimators (e.g. their own fork of XGBoost), but all code is open-source and the examples are still illustrative of the interpretability techniques. These case studies that also deal with practical coding issues and preprocessing steps, e.g. that LIME can be unstable when there are strong correlations between input variables.</description></item></channel></rss>
