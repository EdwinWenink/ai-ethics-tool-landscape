<h1 class=title>Local surrogate models</h1>
<div><p>One approach to explain predictions of &ldquo;black box&rdquo; models is to approximate its predictions with a
<a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/explanations/white-box/>white box</a>
model that <em>is</em> interpretable.
A <em>local</em> surrogate model is a model that does this approximation more accurately only in the &ldquo;local&rdquo; feature space surrounding a single input.
The idea is that even though a white box model may not accurately capture the behavior of a black box model <em>globally</em> (the feature space of a large set of training instances), it may e.g. linearly approximate the feature space <em>local</em> to a single training instance.

<div>
Alibi is an open-source Python library that supports various interpretability techniques and a broad array of explanation types. The README already provides an overview of the supported methods and when they are applicable. The following table with supported methods is copied from the README (slightly abbreviated):

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/>ELI5</a></h1>
<div>
ELI5 (&ldquo;Explain Like I&rsquo;m 5&rdquo;) provides model-specific support for models from scikit-learn, lightning, decision tree ensembles using the xgboost, LightGBM, CatBoost libraries. ELI5 mainly provides convenient wrappers to couple the feature importance coefficients that these libraries already provide with feature names, as well as convenient ways to visualize importances, e.g. by highlighting words in a text. For Keras image classifiers an implementation of the gradient-based Grad-CAM visualizations is offered, but the TensorFlow V2 backend is not supported.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/h2o-mli-resources/>H2O MLI Resources</a></h1>
<div>
This repository by H2O.ai contains useful resources and notebooks that showcase well-known machine learning interpretability techniques. The examples use the h2o Python package with their own estimators (e.g. their own fork of XGBoost), but all code is open-source and the examples are still illustrative of the interpretability techniques. These case studies that also deal with practical coding issues and preprocessing steps, e.g. that LIME can be unstable when there are strong correlations between input variables.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/>LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations</a></h1>
<div>
The type of explanation LIME offers is a surrogate model that approximates a black box prediction locally. The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually sufficiently representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&rsquo;s behaviour.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/>SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</a></h1>
<div>
The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley value and can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.
