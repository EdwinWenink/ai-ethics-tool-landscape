Three modules are provided: ClassicalTextExplainer, UnifiedInformationExplainer and IntrospectiveRationaleExplainer.
Classical Text Explainer The ClassicalTextExplainer supports linear models from sklearn with a coefs_ call and tree-based models for which feature_importances_ is defined.
ClassicalTextExplainer includes a NLP pipeline from preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning, so it accepts raw text data as input. The default pipeline uses a unigram bag-of-words model. Elements of the pipeline can be replaced if desired.</description></item><item><title>SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</title><link>http://example.org/tools/shap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/tools/shap/</guid><description>The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley value and can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.</description></item></channel></rss>
