The README already provides an overview of the supported methods and when they are applicable. The following table with supported methods is copied from the README (slightly abbreviated):

A contrastive explanation answers the question: &amp;ldquo;Why P, rather than Q&amp;rdquo;?
CEM supports such an explanation by finding the minimal set of features that lead to prediction P (a pertinent positive that resembles an anchor explanation), and additionally a minimal set of features that should be absent to maintain decision P instead of the decision for closest class Q (a pertinent negative that is somewhat similar to a counterfactual ).</description></item></channel></rss>
