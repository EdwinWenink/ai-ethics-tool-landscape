The README already provides an overview of the supported methods and when they are applicable. The following table with supported methods is copied from the README (slightly abbreviated):

DiCE implements counterfactual (CF) explanations that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000. In other words, it provides &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.
A main innovation of DiCE is that it implements a method to make producing counter-factual examples more model-agnostic:</description></item></channel></rss>
