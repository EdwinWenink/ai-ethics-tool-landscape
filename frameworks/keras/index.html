The README already provides an overview of the supported methods and when they are applicable. The following table with supported methods is copied from the README (slightly abbreviated):

This package does not seem to be very actively maintained anymore and support for TensorFlow V2 is limited.
Attributions The README gives the following clear and succinct explanation of what an &ldquo;attribution&rdquo; is. All methods included in this approach allow visualization of how each input feature contributes to the final prediction, in terms of what a particular targeted neuron &ldquo;sees&rdquo;:

DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its &lsquo;reference activation&rsquo; and assigns contribution scores according to the difference.

The aim is to contribute to the adaptation of privacy-preserving AI.
To this end, OpenMined offers several privacy-preserving tools on their github. A main tool is PySyft, which allows &ldquo;computing on data you do not own and cannot see&rdquo;.

So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.

Because large neural networks or other differentiable models have a very large learning capacity, it can happen that the model achieves high performance on uncommon training input by simply &ldquo;memorizing&rdquo; the training input. If the training data is sensitive, for example information about a specific user, this is undesired behavior that may leak private information.
