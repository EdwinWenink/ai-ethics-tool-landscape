<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/advbox/>AdvBox</a></h1>
<div>
Advbox offers a number of AI model security toolkits. AdversialBox allows zero-coding generation of adversial examples for a wide range of neural network frameworks. An overview of the supported attacks and defenses can be found here and the corresponding code here. It requires some effort to find all attacks mentioned on the homepage in the code base.
Generally speaking, the documentation of AdvBox is incomplete and not very user-friendly. ODD: Object Detector Deception showcases a specific attack for object detection networks such as YOLO, but is not mentioned in the README.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/alibi-detect/>Alibi Detect</a></h1>
<div>
Alibi Detect is an open source Python library (sister library to Alibi ) focused detecting outliers, adversarial examples, and concept drift.
Finding adversarial examples is relevant for assessing the security of machine learning models. Machine learning models learn complex statistical patterns in datasets. If these statistical patterns &ldquo;drift&rdquo; (in unforeseen ways) after a model is deployed, this will decrease the model performance over time. In systems where model predictions have an impact on people, this may be a threat to the fairness of the predictions.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/art/>ART: Adversial Robustness 360 Toolbox</a></h1>
<div>
The Adversial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is the first comprehensive toolbox that unifies many defensive techniques for four categories of adversarial attacks on machine learning models. These categories are model evasion, model poisoning, model extraction and inference (e.g. inference of sensitive attributes in the training data; or determining whether an example was part of the training data). ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks, all data types and all machine learning tasks.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/cem/>Contrastive Explanation Method (CEM)</a></h1>
<div>
Dhurandhar et al. support a type of contrastive explanation based on what they call pertinent negatives. A contrastive explanation answers the question: &ldquo;Why P, rather than Q&rdquo;?
CEM supports such an explanation by finding the minimal set of features that lead to prediction P (a pertinent positive that resembles an anchor explanation), and additionally a minimal set of features that should be absent to maintain decision P instead of the decision for closest class Q (a pertinent negative that is somewhat similar to a counterfactual ).

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deepexplain/>DeepExplain</a></h1>
<div>
The DeepExplain Python package for TensorFlow models and Keras models with TensorFlow backend offers two types of interpretability methods for deep convolutional neural networks: gradient-based methods and perturbation-based methods. This package does not seem to be very actively maintained anymore and support for TensorFlow V2 is limited.
Attributions The README gives the following clear and succinct explanation of what an &ldquo;attribution&rdquo; is. All methods included in this approach allow visualization of how each input feature contributes to the final prediction, in terms of what a particular targeted neuron &ldquo;sees&rdquo;:

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deeplift/>DeepLIFT</a></h1>
<div>
A brief explanation of the gradient-based interpretability method called DeepLIFT is given by Shrikumar et al. in the abstract of the linked paper:
DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its &lsquo;reference activation&rsquo; and assigns contribution scores according to the difference.

<div>
ELI5 provides model-specific support for models from scikit-learn, lightning, decision tree ensembles using the xgboost, LightGBM, CatBoost libraries. ELI5 mainly provides convenient wrappers to couple the feature importance coefficients that these libraries already provide with feature names, as well as convenient ways to visualize importances, e.g. by highlighting words in a text. For Keras image classifiers an implementation of the gradient-based Grad-CAM visualizations is offered, but the TensorFlow V2 backend is not supported.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/foolbox/>Foolbox</a></h1>
<div>
Foolbox is a comprehensive adversarial library for attacking machine learning models, with a focus on neural networks in computer vision. At the moment of writing FoolBox contains 41 gradient-based and decision-based adversarial attacks, making it the second biggest adversial library after ART . A notable difference with ART is that Foolbox only contains attacks, but no defenses and evaluation metrics.
The library is very user-friendly, with a clear API and documentation.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpretml/>InterpretML</a></h1>
<div>
The InterpretML toolkit, developed at Microsoft, can be decomposed in two major components:
A set of interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems. W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/>LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations</a></h1>
<div>
The type of explanation LIME offers is a surrogate model that approximates a black box prediction locally. The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually sufficiently representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&rsquo;s behaviour.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/>SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</a></h1>
<div>
The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley value and can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.

<h1><a href=https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/tensorflow-privacy/>TensorFlow Privacy</a></h1>
<div>
TensorFlow Privacy is a library that allows you to replace default TensorFlow optimizers with optimizers that allow training with differential privacy, i.e. they implement forms of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with differential privacy.
Because large neural networks or other differentiable models have a very large learning capacity, it can happen that the model achieves high performance on uncommon training input by simply &ldquo;memorizing&rdquo; the training input. If the training data is sensitive, for example information about a specific user, this is undesired behavior that may leak private information.

The What-If Tool (WIT) takes a pretrained model and then allows you to visualize the effect of changing e.g. classification thresholds or the data points themselves on performance, explainability and fairness metrics.
Many convenient functions for gaining insight in the data set are provided, such as binning on particular features, attribution values, or inference scores, computing partial dependence plots, and typical performance indicators such as a confusion matrix or ROC curve.
