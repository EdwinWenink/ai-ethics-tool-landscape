These categories are model evasion, model poisoning, model extraction and inference (e.g. inference of sensitive attributes in the training data; or determining whether an example was part of the training data). ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks, all data types and all machine learning tasks.

It is actively maintained at the moment of writing and supports an extensive array of interpretability methods.
The Captum website also offers a large range of hands-on tutorials for various use cases.
Supported interpretability methods Captum supports a very extensive list of interpretability algorithms. All paper references for each of the supported methods are listed in the README, so they will not be repeated here.

This package does not seem to be very actively maintained anymore and support for TensorFlow V2 is limited.
Attributions The README gives the following clear and succinct explanation of what an &ldquo;attribution&rdquo; is. All methods included in this approach allow visualization of how each input feature contributes to the final prediction, in terms of what a particular targeted neuron &ldquo;sees&rdquo;:

DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its &lsquo;reference activation&rsquo; and assigns contribution scores according to the difference.

ELI5 mainly provides convenient wrappers to couple the feature importance coefficients that these libraries already provide with feature names, as well as convenient ways to visualize importances, e.g. by highlighting words in a text. For Keras image classifiers an implementation of the gradient-based Grad-CAM visualizations is offered, but the TensorFlow V2 backend is not supported.

A set of interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems. W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &ldquo;glassbox&rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.

The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually sufficiently representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&rsquo;s behaviour.

So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.
