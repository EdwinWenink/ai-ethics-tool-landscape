The goal of this method is to asses data quality and mitigate potential problems early on before building models on the data.
According to the authors, their approach is different from the datasheet in that the &amp;ldquo;proposed datasheet [i.e. by Gebru et al.] includes dataset provenance, key characteristics, relevant regulations and test results, but also significant yet more subjective information such as potential bias, strengths and weaknesses of the dataset, API, or model, and suggested uses.</description></item><item><title>Data Statements for NLP</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-statements-for-nlp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/data-statements-for-nlp/</guid><description>A data statement, according to the authors, is &amp;hellip;

Abstract:
The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains. To address this gap, we propose datasheets for datasets. In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information.</description></item><item><title>Debiaswe: try to make word embeddings less sexist</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/debiaswe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/debiaswe/</guid><description>Word embeddings are a widely used representation for text data. A well-known example in natural language processing (NLP) is Word2vec, which uses a neural network to learn latent vector representations of words. It turns out that relations in this latent vector space capture semantic relations quite well. For example, by finding similar vectors you typically end up with highly related or synonymous words. Another typical example is that when you add up the vectors of &amp;ldquo;king&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo;, you end up with the vector corresponding to &amp;ldquo;queen&amp;rdquo;, so even a form of conceptual calculus is possible.</description></item><item><title>DEDA: De Ethische Data Assistent</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deda/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deda/</guid><description>This toolkit developed by the Utrecht Data School supports data analysts, projectmanagers, and policy makers in identifying ethical values and issues in data projects and promoting accountability towards stakeholders. The toolkit is written in Dutch and includes a poster to support brainstorm sessions, an interactive survey, and an accompanying guide with further explanations. On the toolkit&amp;rsquo;s website you can also find several case studies that highlight ethical issues in data projects, as well as a version of the toolkit specifically for researchers.</description></item><item><title>DeepExplain</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deepexplain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deepexplain/</guid><description>The DeepExplain Python package for TensorFlow models and Keras models with TensorFlow backend offers two types of interpretability methods for deep convolutional neural networks: gradient-based methods and perturbation-based methods. This package does not seem to be very actively maintained anymore and support for TensorFlow V2 is limited.
Attributions The README gives the following clear and succinct explanation of what an &amp;ldquo;attribution&amp;rdquo; is. All methods included in this approach allow visualization of how each input feature contributes to the final prediction, in terms of what a particular targeted neuron &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo;:</description></item><item><title>DeepLIFT</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deeplift/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/deeplift/</guid><description>A brief explanation of the gradient-based interpretability method called DeepLIFT is given by Shrikumar et al. in the abstract of the linked paper:
DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its &amp;lsquo;reference activation&amp;rsquo; and assigns contribution scores according to the difference.</description></item><item><title>DiCE: Diverse Counterfactual Explanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/dice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/dice/</guid><description>From README:
DiCE implements counterfactual (CF) explanations that provide this information by showing feature-perturbed versions of the same person who would have received the loan, e.g., you would have received the loan if your income was higher by $10,000. In other words, it provides &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; explanations for model output and can be a useful complement to other explanation methods, both for end-users and model developers.
A main innovation of DiCE is that it implements a method to make producing counter-factual examples more model-agnostic:</description></item><item><title>ELI5</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/eli5/</guid><description>ELI5 provides model-specific support for models from scikit-learn, lightning, decision tree ensembles using the xgboost, LightGBM, CatBoost libraries. ELI5 mainly provides convenient wrappers to couple the feature importance coefficients that these libraries already provide with feature names, as well as convenient ways to visualize importances, e.g. by highlighting words in a text. For Keras image classifiers an implementation of the gradient-based Grad-CAM visualizations is offered, but the TensorFlow V2 backend is not supported.</description></item><item><title>Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC)</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/equity-evaluation-corpus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/equity-evaluation-corpus/</guid><description>This handcrafted dataset can be used to evaluate bias in AI using text data for NLP tasks. Dataset description:
Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems and resources. Further, there is a lack of benchmark datasets for examining inappropriate biases in system predictions. Here, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders.</description></item><item><title>FactSheets: Increasing Trust in AI Services through Supplier's Declaration of Conformity</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/factsheets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/factsheets/</guid><description>FactSheets, as proposed by Arnold et al. from IBM Research, are similar to the model-card and datasheet , but are significantly more comprehensive because they focus on whole AI services. A main difference is that live AI services may comprise several trained models that interact with each other. The model card and datasheet instead concern a single model and the data it is trained on. However, Arnold et al. point out that an AI service with safe components is not necessarily safe overall and &amp;ldquo;so it is prudent to also consider transparency and accountability of services in addition to datasets and models&amp;rdquo; (p.</description></item><item><title>Fairlearn</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairlearn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairlearn/</guid><description>The documentation of fairlearn is excellent and provides a good introduction to the topic of fairness in AI. It is emphasized that fairness algorithms are no plug-and-play technical solutions, but require serious thought about the context of the data and the problem at hand.
Fairness is a fundamentally sociotechnical challenge and cannot be solved with technical tools alone. They may be helpful for certain tasks such as assessing unfairness through various metrics, or to mitigate observed unfairness when training a model.</description></item><item><title>Fairness Decision Tree</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairness-tree/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/fairness-tree/</guid><description>This fairness tree is shown in the web version of the Aequitas bias and fairness audit toolkit. It&amp;rsquo;s main purpose is to help decide on a suitable fairness metric, given the data set and the type of problem. Because this can also be useful to be used with other fairness toolkits, it merited its own entry.</description></item><item><title>H2O MLI Resources</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/h2o-mli-resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/h2o-mli-resources/</guid><description>This repository by H2O.ai contains useful resources and notebooks that showcase well-known machine learning interpretability techniques. The examples use the h2o Python package with their own estimators (e.g. their own fork of XGBoost), but all code is open-source and the examples are still illustrative of the interpretability techniques. These case studies that also deal with practical coding issues and preprocessing steps, e.g. that LIME can be unstable when there are strong correlations between input variables.</description></item><item><title>IBM AI Fairness 360</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/ibm-ai-fairness-360/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/ibm-ai-fairness-360/</guid><description>The IBM AI Fairness 360 Toolkit contains several bias mitigation algorithms that are applicable to various stages of the machine learning pipeline. The toolkit implements different notions of fairness, both on individual and the group level, and several fairness metrics for both classes of fairness. The toolkit provides additional guidance on choosing metrics and mitigation algorithms given a particular goal and application.
The following should be noted when using the fairness toolkit (and other similar toolkits, for that matter):</description></item><item><title>Interpret-Text</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpret-text/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpret-text/</guid><description>Interpret-Text is an extension of InterpretML , specifically for several text models. Three modules are provided: ClassicalTextExplainer, UnifiedInformationExplainer and IntrospectiveRationaleExplainer.
Classical Text Explainer The ClassicalTextExplainer supports linear models from sklearn with a coefs_ call and tree-based models for which feature_importances_ is defined.
ClassicalTextExplainer includes a NLP pipeline from preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning, so it accepts raw text data as input. The default pipeline uses a unigram bag-of-words model. Elements of the pipeline can be replaced if desired.</description></item><item><title>InterpretML</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpretml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/interpretml/</guid><description>The InterpretML toolkit, developed at Microsoft, can be decomposed in two major components:
A set of interpretable &amp;ldquo;glassbox&amp;rdquo; models Techniques for explaining black box systems. W.r.t. 1, InterpretML particularly contains a new interpretable &amp;ldquo;glassbox&amp;rdquo; model that combines Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with machine learning techniques such as gradient boosted trees, called an Explainable Boosting Machine.
Other than this new interpretable model, the main utility of InterpretML is to unify existing explainability techniques under a single API.</description></item><item><title>LIME: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/lime/</guid><description>The type of explanation LIME offers is a surrogate model that approximates a black box prediction locally. The surrogate model is a sparse linear model, which means that the surrogate model is interpretable (in this case, it&amp;rsquo;s weights are meaningful). This simpler model can thus help to explain the black box prediction, assuming the local approximation is actually sufficiently representative.
The intuition behind this is provided in the README:
Intuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model&amp;rsquo;s behaviour.</description></item><item><title>Model cards for Model Reporting</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/model-card/</guid><description>Model cards are an extension of the datasheet to machine learning models.
Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains.</description></item><item><title>SHAP: SHapley Additive exPlanations</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/shap/</guid><description>The SHAP package is built on the concept of a Shapley value and can generate explanations model-agnostically. So it only requires input and output values, not model internals:
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions. (README)
Additionally, this package also contains several model-specific implementations of Shapley values that are optimized for a particular machine learning model and sometimes even for a particular library.</description></item><item><title>SMACTR: End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/smactr/</guid><description>Introduction A major downside of external auditing is that it typically only can be done after model deployment. This paper presents a methodology for internal algorithmic auditing as an integral part of the development process, end-to-end.
Those who move fast and break things, beware:
The audit process is necessarily boring, slow, meticulous and methodical—antithetical to the typical rapid development pace for AI technology. However, it is critical to slow down as algorithms continue to be deployed in increasingly high-stakes domains.</description></item></channel></rss>
