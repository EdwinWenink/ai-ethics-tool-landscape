A well-known example in natural language processing (NLP) is Word2vec, which uses a neural network to learn latent vector representations of words. It turns out that relations in this latent vector space capture semantic relations quite well. For example, by finding similar vectors you typically end up with highly related or synonymous words. Another typical example is that when you add up the vectors of &amp;ldquo;king&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;woman&amp;rdquo;, you end up with the vector corresponding to &amp;ldquo;queen&amp;rdquo;, so even a form of conceptual calculus is possible.</description></item><item><title>Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC)</title><link>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/equity-evaluation-corpus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edwinwenink.github.io/ai-ethics-tool-landscape/tools/equity-evaluation-corpus/</guid><description>This handcrafted dataset can be used to evaluate bias in AI using text data for NLP tasks. Dataset description:
Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems and resources. Further, there is a lack of benchmark datasets for examining inappropriate biases in system predictions. Here, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders.</description></item></channel></rss>
